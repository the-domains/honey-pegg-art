  I grew up with a strong passion for animals and the wonders of nature that
  encircled me in the countryside. I frequently had pencils and paper in my
  hand, sat at my little wooden desk with my hair forming a curtain around my
  face and my nose to the paper, predominantly drawing animals. At school I
  studied pottery and I then trained as a Master Picture Framer. Unable to leave
  my love of graphite for long I continued to draw people portraits from
  magazines, books and record covers as I had a terrible collection of photos I
  had taken myself. Luckily I now have quite a collection of fabulous Nikon
  cameras and can take many references from my own photographs. Completely
  self-taught in all my mediums, I held my first art exhibition in 2001 which
  was met with great interest and enthusiasm, selling my original drawings,
  silks, paintings and limited edition prints. Now I have discovered the art of
  Pyrography, fine art burnt on finely sanded special woods, rag paper or even
  on thick watercolour paper. It is a new venture for me and Iâ€™m thoroughly
  enjoying being immersed into something completely new and teaching myself a
  new skill. I have also recently started some works with glass engraving,
  pastels and bottle tops....all will soon be revealed!
